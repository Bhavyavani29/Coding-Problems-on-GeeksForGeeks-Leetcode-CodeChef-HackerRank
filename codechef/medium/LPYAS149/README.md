## Problem

### Increase the integer

Write a program that takes an integer  **T**  for number of test cases as input, then for each test case reads an integer  **N**  on next  **T**  lines, and prints  **N + 1**  for each test case.

### Sample 1:

3
4
2
-1
```

```
5
3

        print(N + 1)
        t -= 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
