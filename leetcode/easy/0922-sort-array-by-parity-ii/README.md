# Sort Array By Parity II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums`, half of the integers in `nums` are  **odd**, and the other half are  **even**.

Sort the array so that whenever `nums[i]` is odd, `i` is  **odd**, and whenever `nums[i]` is even, `i` is  **even**.

Return  *any answer array that satisfies this condition*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,3]
Output: [2,3]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- nums.length is even.
- Half of the integers in nums are even.
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

                nums[even] = nums[odd];
                nums[odd] = temp;
                even += 2;
                odd += 2;
            }
        }

    }
