# Intersection of Arrays with Distinct

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two  **unsorted**  integer arrays  **a[]**  and  **b[]** each consisting of  **distinct**  elements, the task is to return the  **count**  of elements in the  **intersection**  (or common elements) of the two arrays.

Intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a[] = [89, 24, 75, 11, 23], b[] = [89, 2, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: 89 is the only element in the intersection of two arrays.
```

```
Input: a[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], b[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output: 4
Explanation: 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the elements in the intersection of two arrays.
```

```
Input: a[] = [20, 10, 30, 50, 40], b[] = [15, 25, 30, 20, 35]
Output: 2
Explanation: 20 and 30 are the elements in the intersection of the two arrays.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1  ≤  a.size(), b.size() ≤  105
1  ≤  a[i], b[i]  ≤  105

```java
class Solution {
    public static int intersectSize(int a[], int b[]) {
        // Your code here
        HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0;i < a.length;i++){
            hs.add(a[i]);
        }
        HashSet<Integer> intersection = new HashSet<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < b.length;i++){
            if(hs.contains(b[i])){
                intersection.add(b[i]);
            }
        }
        return intersection.size();
    }
}
```
