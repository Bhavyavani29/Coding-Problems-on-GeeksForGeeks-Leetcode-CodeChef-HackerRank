# Direct Edge Between Two Vertices

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an undirected graph containing  **V**  vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1, represented by a 2D adjacency list  **adj[][]**, where each  **adj[i]**  represents the list of vertices connected to vertex **i**. You are also given two vertices  **u**  and  **v**. Your task is to determine whether there is a direct edge between u and v in the graph.
If an edge exists between u and v, return  **true** ; otherwise, return  **false.** 

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: adj[][] = [[1, 3, 4], [0, 2], [1, 4], [0], [0, 2]], u = 0, v = 3
   
Output: true 
Explanation: The graph contains edges (0-1), (0-4), (0-3) (1-2) and (2-4). Since there is a direct edge between vertices 0 and 3, the output is true.
```

```
Input: adj[][] = [[2, 3, 4], [3], [0, 3], [0, 1, 2], [0]], u = 3, v = 4
   
Output: false
Explanation: The graph contains edges (0-2), (0-3), (0-4), (1-3) and (2-3). Since there is no direct edge between vertices 3 and 4, the output is false.
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ V = adj.size() ≤ 104
0 ≤ adj[i][j], u, v < V

class Solution {
    public boolean checkEdge(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int u, int v) {
        //   code here
        return adj.get(u).contains(v);
    }
}
```
