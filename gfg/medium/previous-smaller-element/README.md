# Previous Smaller Element

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array  **arr[ ]**.  The task is to find Previous Smaller Element (PSE) for every element in the array. The Previous Smaller Element (PSE) of an element  **x**  is the first element that appears to the left of  **x**  in the array and is strictly smaller than  **x**.

 **Note:**  If no such element exists, assign  **-1**  as the PSE for that position.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2]
Output: [-1, 1, 1]
Explanation:
For 1, there is no element on the left, so answer is -1.
For 6, previous smaller element is 1.
For 2, previous smaller element is 1.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 0, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [-1, 1, -1, 0, 3, 4]
Explanation:
For 1, no element on the left, so answer is -1.
For 5, previous smaller element is 1.
For 0, no element on the left smaller than 0, so answer is -1.
For 3, previous smaller element is 0.
For 4, previous smaller element is 3.
For 5, previous smaller element is 4.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```java
class Solution {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> prevSmaller(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            ans.add(-1);
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            while(!st.isEmpty() && arr[st.peek()]>arr[i]){
                // ans[st.pop()] = arr[i];
                ans.set(st.pop(),arr[i]);
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
